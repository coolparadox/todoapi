# todoapi
A todo list RESTful API wannabe

This is a personal, unfinished, ongoing implementation of a todo list as a RESTful API written in Go.
It's far from being production ready yet.

I'm writing it as I learn about network affairs in Go. I started with the blog post [Making a RESTful JSON API in Go](http://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/) by Cory Lanou, and slowly drifted away from it in a few approaches (eg. stick with the default http Go library) due to didactic purposes. See commit logs for details.

Cheers,
Rafael Lorandi
